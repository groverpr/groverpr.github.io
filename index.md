I am a Research Scientist at AWS. I like to write about machine learning and deep learning. I have written a few posts on medium. [link to blog on medium](https://medium.com/@pgrover3). I am starting to use github pages for my new blog series using `fast_template`. The first blogpost is on transfer learning.
