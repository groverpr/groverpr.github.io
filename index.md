I am a Research Scientist at AWS. I like to write about machine learning and deep learning. I have written a few posts on medium - [link to my blog on medium](https://medium.com/@pgrover3). I am trying out github pages for my new blog series with [fast_template](https://github.com/fastai/fast_template) and [nbdev](http://nbdev.fast.ai/). The first blogpost is on transfer learning.
